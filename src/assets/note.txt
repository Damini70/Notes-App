🟢 Things I completed:
- Fully functional Notes app using React, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript
- Add, edit, and delete top-level notes
- Add, edit, and delete subnotes under each note
- Search feature that filters notes and subnotes by keywords
- Highlighted search terms inside notes and subnotes
- Modular component-based architecture
- Clean UI using Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Add persistent storage using localStorage 
- Use TypeScript for strong typing
- Test on mobile & desktop
- Make sure the final UI is clean and intuitive

🕒 With more time, I would:
- Add animations (e.g., smooth transitions for editing/adding notes) using Framer Motion
- Improve accessibility by:
  → Adding keyboard navigation
  → Ensuring better contrast and focus indicators

🌐 SEO / Accessibility / Performance:
- App uses semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Responsive layout using Tailwind ensures usability across screen sizes
- Search is performant for medium datasets (client-side filtering)
- Highlights using <mark> tag for better UX
- UI components reuse state efficiently via Redux and local component states
